# Visual layout

## Base layer

- `Gesc` = Escape when pressed, ` when Shift or GUI are held.
- `Rs Enter` = Right Shift when held, Enter when tapped.
- `Ctrl Del` = Right Control when held, Delete when tapped.
- `Func` = Function layer when held Tab or ' when tapped.
- `Lower` &dArr; and `Raise` &uArr; are layer keys.
- `Lower` &dArr; is Tap toggle = Acts like a Momentarily layer unless itâ€™s tapped multiple times, which toggles the layer on.

- `Game` and `NumPad` are toggle layers keys.


# Layout goals and thoughts
I felt the need to have access to `Enter` with both hands and using the thumb for `Enter` feels better but I still use the Shift/Enter key sometimes.

The game layer is mainly for apex and csgo/valo, `1234` is used to cycle through weapons and utilities, so far I did not found a comfortable spot for the `4` key and thats the only key that i need to rebind ingame, currently using a mouse button for that.
